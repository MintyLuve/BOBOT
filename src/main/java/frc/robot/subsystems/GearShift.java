/*** README
 *  In this assignment you will be programming a DoubleSolenoid GearShift.
 *  On our test bed this is just a simple actuator on open air, but on the real robot it will be controlling our robots gearshift!
 *  In competition, you may use a gearshift to allow your robot to have a low gear (for maximum pushing power) and a high gear (for that sweet sweet speed).
 * 
 *  In this file, I would like to see:
 *      - gearShiftUp
 *      - gearShiftDown
 * 
 *   This file will require the following Class (Documentation):
 *      - https://first.wpi.edu/wpilib/allwpilib/docs/release/java/edu/wpi/first/wpilibj/DoubleSolenoid.html
 * 
 * 
 *    As always if you feel I've missed something or need help, please feel free to reach out to me on slack or in person! (Depending where I am at the time! =D)
